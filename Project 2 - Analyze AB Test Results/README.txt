Project 2 - Hypothesis A/B testing:

    Introduction to the dataset: This dataset is concerned with an old version of a certain site and a newly designed version. It is the results of a trial made on some customers who recieved the new design and if they preferred it to the old design or not.

    The Goal: The goal here is to test whether the customers prefer the new version of our site to the old one or not. It is a hypothesis A/B testing project.

    Tools used:

    Python -> To display our dataset and perform data analysis techniques through different functions and commands. It was also used to draw visuals to identify statistical trends in the dataset like the p-value.

    Jupyter Notebook -> To display all the work done using python on the data set and display the visuals in order to find the needed conclusions.

    Approaches used: Regression -> Used through the hypothesis testing process to identify the correlation between certain factors and others.

    Probability -> To test whether the null hypothesis is true or we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
